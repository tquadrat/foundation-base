     *  thread's stack. The effect of the {@code stackSize} parameter, if any,
     *  is highly platform dependent.</p>
     *  <p>On some platforms, specifying a higher value for the
     *  {@code stackSize} parameter may allow a thread to achieve greater
     *  recursion depth before throwing a
     *  {@link StackOverflowError}.
     *  Similarly, specifying a lower value may allow a greater number of
     *  threads to exist concurrently without throwing an
     *  {@link OutOfMemoryError}
     *  (or other internal error). The details of the relationship between the
     *  value of the {@code stackSize} parameter and the maximum recursion
     *  depth and concurrency level are platform-dependent. On some platforms,
     *  the value of the {@code stackSize} parameter may have no effect
     *  whatsoever.</p>
     *  <p>The virtual machine is free to treat the stackSize parameter as a
     *  suggestion. If the specified value is unreasonably low for the
     *  platform, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific
     *  minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably high, the virtual
     *  machine may instead use some platform-specific maximum. Likewise, the
     *  virtual machine is free to round the specified value up or down as it
     *  sees fit (or to ignore it completely).</p>
     *  <p>Specifying a value of zero for the {@code stackSize} parameter will
     *  cause the new tread factory to not set the stack size for the new
     *  threads explicitly.</p>
     *
     *  @note Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behaviour regarding
     *      this configuration value, extreme care should be exercised in its
     *      use. The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation
     *      will likely vary from one JRE implementation to another. In light
     *      of this variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may
     *      be required, and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE
     *      implementation on which an application is to run.
