This library is the base for all the other *Foundation* libraries, although it is not much useful for other general purpose projects without the *[foundation-util](https://tquadrat.github.io/foundation-util)* library. But for some tools I worked on, not all the stuff that is contained in *foundation-util* was necessary or it was just to big, so I separated out some functionality into this library.
